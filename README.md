# OwOify

**A mod that shall make you question my sanity.**

## What does it do?

**Simple, all text (all I could) will be OwOified!**

## OwOified? What do you mean?

**It means text wiww be wwitten wike this.**

## Oh, God... This mod is terrible.

**I know.**

## I actually like this mod, why are you so sarcastic?

**I- What is wrong with you?**

## Customization?

**Yes. There's a configuration file that will allow you to edit some stuff related to the mod.**

## If there is customization, then what can I customize?

**Allow me to explain the configuration to you, then...**

- owOifyText (Boolean, default: true) - If true, all text gets OwOified, replacing 'r' and 'l' with 'w';

#

- emotionifyText (Enum, default: NONE) - Change this one to  make text either all upper-case or lower-case.

How to change it:
- NONE - Minecraft's default text display;
- YELLIFY - All text is in upper-case;
- WHISPERIFY - All text is in lower-case.

NOTE: This one is glitchy, not quite sure how it is caused, but I also don't care enough to look for the bug and fix it.

Just be aware that translatable text might not work correctly with this one.

#

- reversifyText (Boolean, default: false) - If true, text will be displayed backwards.

NOTE: This one is also very glitchy, it'll corrupt entirely the display of settings and any other text with parameters.

Again, I don't care enough to fix it.

#

- eminemifyText (Boolean, default: false) - If true, all spaces will be removed from text.

## Why? Why did you make this?

**Haha~ That's a very good question...**
